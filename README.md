# ENCODN

#### Hacktoberfest2020-perfect | Beginner-friendly | Easy-to-understand

This is perfect for new contributors who want to make **meaningful PR's** and are familiar with basic Python3. Please check the [contributing.md](contributing.md) file for rules and ideas about possible contributions.

##### About ENCODN:
This is a simple Python3 GUI based user interface whose original idea is based on [dcode.fr](https://dcode.fr/en/tools-list), you can refer to the link for an overview. The main frame has various tool options that open into a dropdown of more categories, as classified on dcode.fr, which lead you to fun encoder-decoder tools, game solving, puzzle solving, calculation based, cyphertext related basic as well as genome programming, image processing, live data manipulation related advanced tools.
The module used to implement this is Tkinter which is easy to learn.

##### Repository Structure:
To avoid long messy codes we have broken up the GUI into directories of .py files as follows:
* Main window looping in ENCODN.py
* Structural frames in /FRAMES
* All buttons in /BUTTONS
* Various tools in /TOOLS where all categories have a different directory and divided into further sub-directories accordingly that eventually lead to two files:  (i) XYZ.py that contains a simple python program to execute the desired task, and (ii) XYZ-FRAME.py that contains the GUI part of the XYZ tool which uses the functionality of XYZ.py on command call. As you visit the directories, the structure will become clearer.

##### Live Demo:

##### Additional:
We need a logo for ENCODN. If you're a graphic designer or just for the fun of it, wish to design a logo for the GUI you are most welcome to open an issue for logo contribution. It will still be counted as a meaningful PR.
